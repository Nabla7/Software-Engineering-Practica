# Project Management

## Part 1:

**Risk Table**

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| 1. **Integration with Legacy Systems** | | | |
| The need to ensure compatibility with the existing IT-infrastructure such as single-sign-on systems and Microsoft Outlook. | High | The inability to integrate effectively can cause disruptions in service, user dissatisfaction, and administrative burdens. | Collaborate with the IT department to understand legacy system architectures and interfaces. Employ middleware or dedicated integration teams to ensure smooth transitions and connections. |
| 2. **99.99% Uptime for Streaming Services** | | | |
| Guaranteeing an uptime of 99.99% for both lecture recordings and live broadcasts. | Medium | Failing to meet this can lead to significant disruptions in teaching and learning. Potential dissatisfaction among students and faculty. | Implement redundant server infrastructure and adopt cloud-based solutions that can auto-scale based on demand. Regularly monitor and maintain servers. |
| 3. **AI-Powered Course Recommendations** | | | |
| Utilizing AI to provide personalized program and course recommendations using ChatGPT. | Medium | If not implemented correctly, students might receive irrelevant or misleading recommendations, leading to poor academic decisions. | Collaborate closely with AI experts and possibly OpenAI to best utilize ChatGPT. Use a diverse dataset for training and ensure regular updates and validations based on feedback. |
| 4. **Blockchain Database Security and Privacy** | | | |
| Using Blockchain technology to ensure student data security and privacy. | High | If not properly implemented, it might expose sensitive student information, grades, and other personal data, leading to severe legal and reputation issues. | Engage blockchain experts and conduct regular security audits. Ensure GDPR and other legal compliance. Educate stakeholders about blockchainâ€™s benefits and limitations. |
| 5. **Dynamic Scalability of Video Infrastructure** | | | |
| Supporting variable viewership throughout the day and semester, ensuring no wasted capacity. | Medium | Failure could lead to poor video streaming quality during high-demand periods or wastage of resources during low-demand times. | Adopt cloud-based video hosting solutions that offer dynamic scaling based on real-time demand. Employ a dedicated team for continuous monitoring and adjusting as needed. |
