**Discussion of Each Issue**

### Critical Issue: Parameters Not Checked
- **Comment:** "In several methods, such as `addItemToCart` and `login`, parameters are not validated before use. This can lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior."
- **Team Discussion:** Suggestions for implementing null checks and parameter validation.
- **Decision:** Implement parameter checking in all methods where itâ€™s currently missing.
- **Action Item:** Assign a team member to add parameter checks and create unit tests for validation.

### Severe Issue: No Destructor
- **Comment:** "Our classes, particularly those managing resources like `HashMaps`, lack destructors. This could lead to memory leaks or resource mismanagement."
- **Team Discussion:** Evaluate the need for destructors or finalizers in Java and alternative resource management techniques.
- **Decision:** As Java has garbage collection, focus on ensuring resource management within methods, specifically close or release resources where needed.
- **Action Item:** Review resource management in all classes, ensure proper handling.

### Moderate Issue: No Header Content
- **Comment:** "Several classes and methods are missing header comments, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage."
- **Team Discussion:** Importance of documentation for maintainability and onboarding new team members.
- **Decision:** Add comprehensive header comments to all classes and public methods.
- **Action Item:** Divide the codebase among team members to add missing header comments.

### Moderate Issue: No Declaration Comments
- **Comment:** "Variables and constants, especially those with non-descriptive names, are missing declaration comments."
- **Team Discussion:** Discuss balancing descriptive naming with the need for comments.
- **Decision:** Where variable names are not self-explanatory, add declaration comments for clarity.
- **Action Item:** Assign team members to review and comment on variable and constant declarations.
