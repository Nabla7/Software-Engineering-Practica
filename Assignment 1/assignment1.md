### Scenarios
| Student enrolls in a program |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Audience** | System development team |
| **Level** | Specific functionality |
| **Granularity** | Detailed |
| **Preconditions** | Student has an account on the platform. There is an administrative aid linked to each program to process enrollments. |
| **Success condition** | Student is enrolled in the program they chose and enrollment is send to the correct administrative aid. If the deadline has passed, there should have been approval from an administrative aid |
| **Fail condition** | Student can enroll in a program after the deadline without approval from a administrative aid. Student cannot enroll in a program before the deadline. An enrollment is not send or send to the wrong administrative aid. Administrative aid cannot give approval for late enrollments. |
| **Primary actors** | Student |
| **Secondary actors** | Administrative aids |
| **Trigger** | Student enrolls |


| **Plagiarism detection on student assignments** ||
| --- | --- |
| **Audience** | System development team |
| **Level** | Specific Functionality |
| **Granularity** | Detailed |
| **Preconditions** | Assignments have been submitted and the deadline is closed |
| **Succes condition** | The plagiarism detection program runs after the deadline and checks the chance the student committed plagiarism|
| **Fail condition** | The plagiarism detection software fails to find if a student has committed plagiarism |
| **Primary actors** | Professor, assistant |
| **Secondary actors** | |
| **Trigger** |The deadline of an assignment has passed |


### Step by step description of execution of Plagiarism detection on student assignments
| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Deadline of an assignment has passed |
| 2 | The system retrieves the submitted assignments from the server |
| 3 | For each assignment that is returned from the server : |
| 3.1 | The system calculates the similarity scores and adds it to the plagiarism report |
| 3.2 | If the systems find a similarity above a certain threshold it flags the assignment |
| 4 | The system generates a plagiarism report and attaches it to the assignments |
| 5 | The system notifies the professor / teaching assistant of the flagged assignments |
| **Branch** | Exceptions |
| Any | If the system fails or crashes it should notify the software devolpment team with an error log |
|Â After 2 | If there are no submissions, the system should stop running |



## User story cards

### Plagiarism detection
   *As a professor I want all the assignments to be checked by plagiarism detection software and a report of it attached to the assignment. This way academic integrity is ensured.*

 ## Questions for the customer:
* From what grade of similarity with outside sources should assignments be flagged as "potentially plagiarized"
* Do we use this system to ask approval of the administrative aid when a student is late for enrollment, or is this a completely different system?
